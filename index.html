		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<h3>Connect with me</h3>
			
			<p>Hello! My name is Eric Mercado. I am 21 years old, and am currently enrolled in the UT Coding Bootcamp. I was previously at Austin Community College, but I was not ambitious in my class at all, as I felt I was just merely attending the classes more so than trying to excell in them.</p>

			<p>My interests involve Martial Arts, and video games. I had taken Tae Kwon Do before but after middle school, martial arts just faded from my identity until I was 18.
